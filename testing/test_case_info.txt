Test Case Info 
==========

Misc 
----------
- input and output redirection:
    - we can redirect a file with a test case in it as our input, then redirect the output of the program to a file like this:
        ./sim < testing/input_files/input.txt > testing/results/output.txt
    - pretty sure that it just delimits by whitespace, line breaks are for clarity

- we should document what we're representing and/or targeting with the different test cases in this document going forward, will help us stay organized and will be a good reference 

- didn't bother yet, but it would be easy to set up a bash script that would run a whole bunch of instances of the sim with different input and output values so we don't have to do it manually


FCFS
----------
- fcfs_1.txt
    - processes arrive at staggered times 
    - gaps in schedule shows lower CPU utilization 

- fcfs_2.txt
    - mix of shorter and longer processes 
    - should highlight differences in waiting and turnaround time 
    - can check out impact of process length
