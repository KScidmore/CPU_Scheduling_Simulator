==========

- Quality assurance practices: 
    - code reviews and version control: 
        - regularly meet throughout development phases to review code and integrate changes to main branch of repo 
    - error handling and failure modes 
        - doing our best to make sure we handle return values, error handling, failure points, error messaging, etc 
    
- Test Plan: 
    - scheduling algorithms:
        - metric accuracy testing documents have been created for the purpose of testing the scheduling algorithms 
            - two documents called metric-testing-1.pdf and metric-testing-2.pdf 
        - in each file, a selected number of processes with attribute values were determined, then the metrics for the performance of each algorithm were manually calculated on paper 
        - the simulation is then run with the same test data and the reported metrics are compared against the manually calculated results to determine accuracy 
    - queue, string operations, etc: 
        - assertion testing 
        - print statement testing 
        - not that much of this in the program honestly, needed to be more thorough about the scheudling algorithms, overall
