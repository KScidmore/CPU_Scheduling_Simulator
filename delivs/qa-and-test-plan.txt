==========

- Quality assurance practices: 
    - code reviews and version control: 
        - regularly meet throughout development phases to review code and integrate changes to main branch of repo 
    - error handling and failure modes 
        - doing our best to make sure we handle return values, error handling, failure points, error messaging, etc 
    
- Test Plan: 
    - scheduling algorithm:
        - metric accuracy testing document created for the purpose of testing the scheduling algorithms 
        - selected number of processes with determined attributes decided upon, then metrics are manually calculated on paper 
        - the simulation is then run with the same test data and the reported metrics are compared against the manually calculated results 
    - queue, string operations, etc: 
        - assertion testing 
        - print statement testing 
        - not that much of this in the program honestly, needed to be more thorough about the scheudling algorithms, overall 

- the test cases for the test plan are included in the document called metric-testing.pdf
